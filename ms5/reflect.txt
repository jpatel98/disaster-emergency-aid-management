I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Through this project, the main takwaway I got is that OOP is all about using objects and classes. I used it to handle and store different items like perishable and non-perishable items that can be used during an emergency. I created classes for these items, and this showed me how helpful OOP is for organizing complex things. For rxample how making a base class can save time since we don't have to write the same code again and again.

I also learned about keeping parts of a class private, which is like making sure only certain parts can be modified. This helps keep the data safe. I used  getters and setters for this, and it taught me why keeping data safe in programming is important.

It showed me how useful OOP is in real world applications. The project was not easy, but I now know a lot more about breaking problems into smaller parts and solving them.

Another important lesson in OOP I learned about is polymorphism. It sounds complex, but it's just a way to use objects from different classes in the same way. This made handling various types of items much easier in my project.
